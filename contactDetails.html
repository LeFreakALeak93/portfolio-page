        <h3>Something about myself</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Lukas and I'm 30 years old. Recently I graduated from Ironhack bootcamp, where I discovered my passion for web development.
            In all of our projects, I was able to put HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript into practice and build a responsive browser game.
            Even implementing the backend-side of a beer onlineshop was one of my task. For that I used React framework, Express.js and Node.js.
            To retrieve data from the database, I occupied myself with MongoDB and Mongoose. And allthough, it was quite challenging certain times, I was very ambitious to sucessfully finish the project
            and deliver high quality of code. Besides coding a long, I like to calm myself down with yoga, lift heavy weights in the gym and spend time with my loving girlfriend and family.

        </p>
